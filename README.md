# ESCenterlines
Plugin to display extended centerlines in Euroscope, currently no too smart.

### Installation
Put the dll file somewhere, load it in EuroScope and allow it to draw on desired display types (open ASRs need to be reopened for this to have any effect).
EsCenterLines-EDDM.dll is a special version for EDDM (surprisingly)

### Display
- .esclines off - no lines are displayed
- .esclines rwy - lines are displayed for active landing runways
- .esclines apt - lines are displayed for all runways of active airports
- .esclines on  - all lines are displayed (nobody wants this. really.)

### Color
- .esclines color - opens a colorpicker. This setting is not active in all ASRs immediately, ASRs need to be reloaded.
