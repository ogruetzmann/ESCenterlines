# ESCenterlines
Will be an addon to display extended centerlines in VATSIM controller client EuroScope.

Currently doesn't do much but some stupid 20 NM lines.

Depends on GeographicLib (http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/)
Requires Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
