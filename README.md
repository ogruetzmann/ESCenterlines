# ESCenterlines

This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

Will be an addon to display extended centerlines in VATSIM controller client EuroScope.
Currently draws standard lines, length 30 NM, with range markers at 4, 10 and 20 NM.

* ".cline display" toggles the lines
* ".cline active" toggles between displaying all lines and lines for active runways only.

Needs to be allowed to draw on the necessary Radar Screens (in Plug-ins Dialog).


* Depends on the EuroScope PlugIn environment (http://euroscope.hu/)
* Depends on GeographicLib (http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/)
* Requires Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
